The brand new Good Karma API
=============================

We're excited to announce v1 of the [Good Karma API](http://goodkarmaapp.com). With only a few HTTP calls, you can let your customers, users, or visitors to your site give to nonprofits of their choice. It's a great way to align your brand with the interests of your users.

Making a request
-----------------

All URLs start with `https://goodkarmaapp.com/api/v1/`

Authentication
---------------

In order to make an API call you must provide an API key in the authentication header. It should be in the form:

Authentication: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

We are currently in beta so if you are interesting in trying this out, feel free to get in touch and we will provide you with a key to use for the time being.
